5. What is React.Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

Your answer:

- <React.Fragment>
  Is what you would use specifically in react to input data to be used, you can also use <div> tags but it may be better to use <> if the data is relying on many <div> tags.

  Allow you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM, fragments are not rendered to the DOM, so in turn you can use it instead of a div.

6. What does it mean to create a responsive web application? What are three options for creating responsive design?

9. STRETCH: What is a ternary operator in JavaScript?

Your answer:

- A simplified syntax of an if/ else statement.

Researched answer:

- Ternary operator should evaluate boolean value, ? will seperate truthy outcome, and a : will seperate truthy from the falsey outcome. Used for refactoring.

10. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer:

- anonymous function is a a method used without having to specifically call it.

Researched answer:

- Anonymous function is a function without a name, but not always accessable after initial creation

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

- Ruby: Is an object oriented language, preinstalled into macs, Ruby is a general-purpose, interpreted, dynamically typed, server-side scripting language, can be embedded in HTML, uses Object Oriented Programming.

- Object oriented programming: OOP was created to deal with complex software to deal with how fast applications were growing in complexity. You are able to maintain a better app when working on smaller component/ objects it doesnt effect the main parent code.

- RSpec:Uses red-green-refactoring for test driven development, its composed of multiple libraries, its flexible and customizable.

- Instance variable: Is a type of class atribute.
- Ruby blocks: are anonymous functions in Ruby, created with do/end keywords or {}. Its a grouping of statements that are written on the same line as the method calls last parameter.

- Ruby hashes: Is a collection of keys and their value pairs, similar to and array and also can use iterable methods on a hash.
- `getter` and `setter` methods in Ruby: They allow to get the classes instance variable outside the class,`getter` methods are used to `get` the value of an instance variable and binds an object property to a function that can be called upon. While `setter` methods are used to `set` the value of an instance variable and binds an object property to a function to be called when there is an attempt to set the property.

P.S. I utilized Sarah, Brian and my fellow classmates a lot through this, would not have been able to finish the code-challenges.js without their help. I am focusing heavily this week on going through the syllabus and create flash cards for myself to start instilling the fundamentals deeper in my brain. As of now I can see the logic and even talk about it, but when I try and type it out, its a blank wall. very difficult for me. but its all about the push for greatness, and this week will become better!
